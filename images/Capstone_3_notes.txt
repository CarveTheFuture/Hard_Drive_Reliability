Count of hours in power-on state. The raw value of this attribute shows total count of hours (or minutes, or seconds, depending on manufacturer) in power-on state.[27]
"By default, the total expected lifetime of a hard disk in perfect condition is defined as 5 years (running every day and night on all days). This is equal to 1825 days in 24/7 mode or 43800 hours."[28]


often written as SMART) is a monitoring system included in computer hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs),[1] and eMMC drives. Its primary function is to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability with the intent of anticipating imminent hardware failures.

When S.M.A.R.T. data indicates a possible imminent drive failure, software running on the host system may notify the user so preventive action can be taken to prevent data loss, and the failing drive can be replaced and data integrity maintained.

On some pre-2005 drives, this raw value may advance erratically and/or "wrap around" (reset to zero periodically).[29]

Since 2013, 
Backblaze has been generating 1 comma separated values spreadsheet with 
one entry per day 
for each of the 100s of thousands of drives in its data center. Each spreadsheet entry records  more than 50 of the 255 S.M.A.R.T. hard drive monitoring metrics.
